# -process-scheduling-simulator
This project is a process scheduling simulator developed for a college assignment. It implements the Multilevel Feedback Queue (MFQ) algorithm, a dynamic CPU scheduling strategy that uses multiple queues with different priority levels and allows processes to move between them based on their behavior and execution time.
